# CodeRefactor
Welcome to CodeRefractor, an optimized and accessible friendly version of Horiseon digital marketing agency's website.

CodeRefractor is designed to meet 2020's accessibility standards, thus optimizing it for search engines. We are confident that this current version will improve Horiseon's clients experience as they visit the website. It will also make Horiseon Section 508 compliant, as well as other web accessibility laws and standards.

This work is performed by Dorine Ketchiozo, Current UNC Charlotte Bootcamp student.
